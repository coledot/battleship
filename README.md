# Battleship

Battleship in Ruby/Rails and Coffeescript. If it looks janky, that's on purpose.

NOTE: To start a new game, you must restart the server. The database is cleared on restart as well.

Usage:

    - `bundle exec rails server`

    - First player should point their browser to localhost:3000, a ship layout will be assigned to them

    - Repeat for second player

    - ...and that's it for now :/
